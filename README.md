## Features

- **User Registration & Authentication**
  - Register as customer or manager (role specified during onboarding)
  - Unique email and phone number validation

  - Customers can buy available cars
  - Car status updates to sold, and `soldAt` is recorded

- **User-Specific Car Fetching**
  - Customers can fetch cars they have bought (sorted by `soldAt`)
  - Managers can fetch cars they have added (sorted by `createdAt`)

- **Pagination & Filtering**
  - Reusable pagination utility for all list endpoints
  - Flexible filtering by fields, including date range and price

- **Validation**
  - Joi-based request validation for all endpoints
  - Middleware for validating MongoDB ObjectIds

## Validation & Error Handling

- All endpoints use Joi for request validation.
- Custom exceptions for unauthorized, bad request, and conflict errors.
- Middleware for validating MongoDB ObjectIds.

---

## Pagination

All list endpoints support pagination via `page` and `limit` query parameters.  
Filtering and sorting are also supported.

---

## Usage Notes

- Only a car can be added at a time, but the logic can be scaled for bulk operations.
- Already sold cars cannot be updated or deleted.
- If a category is in use, deleting it only updates its status.
- When fetching `/api/v1/cars/user`, the result is sorted by:
  - `soldAt` for customers (cars they bought)
  - `createdAt` for managers (cars they added)
