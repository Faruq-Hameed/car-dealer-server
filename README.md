# Car Dealer Server

A RESTful API for managing a car dealership, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.  
Supports user authentication, car and category management, and robust role-based access control.

## Features

- **User Registration & Authentication**
  - Register as customer or manager (role specified during onboarding)
